        <dt>Pizza dough Ingredients</dt>
        <dd>2 ½ cups warm water</dd>
        <dd>1 teaspoon sugar</dd>
        <dd>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</dd>
        <dd>7 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</dd>
        <dd>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</dd>
        <dd>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</dd>
        <dt>Pepperoni Toppings</dt>
        <dd>Tomato  sauce</dd>
        <dd>Fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces</dd>
        <dd>Sliced spicy pepperoni </dd>

        <dd>Red pepper flakes</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, “Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling sugar and yeast in  warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes. You'll see bubbles form on the surface.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture slowly. Using a spoon, mix until a evenly wet dough begins to form.</li>
        <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside. Turn the dough to coat with the oil and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and turn it onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven anywhere between 425-475˚F. Place a heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat) in the oven.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, take the tomato sauce and heat it on a skillet adding salt and any desired seasonings.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has rested, poke the surface until bubbles form.</li>
        <li>Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin circle. Thinner is better, the pizza will bpuff out during baking.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add red pepper or parmesean as garnish and cut to share!</li>
    </ol>
